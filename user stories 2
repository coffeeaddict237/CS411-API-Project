I am the granddaughter who helped my grandpa sign up for Facebook and showed him how to get to the app and how to save all the movies he wants to watch. He was very stubborn so it took a while for me to explain how to log into Facebook. I told him how he needs to use his email and create a password. I also had to teach him how to use the app and how to choose movies to watch. It was very difficult to explain to him about the many different genres and when you pick a genre a new list of movies show up and you can pick again. I know my grandpa wants to watch scary Halloween movies but I’m a teenager who just broke up with her boyfriend and doesn’t want to scroll through Netflix. I just want to watch a very depressing and sad movie so I can cry my eyes out all night. I log into the app through my Facebook so I can tell all my friends and family how sad I’m feeling and what types of movies I’m watching to get me over my depression. My friends and family can also give me recommendations through Facebook about which movies I should watch. After logging into Facebook, I search through the different genres based on my mood and pick the tear-jerker and drama genres. Then a list of movies come out and I pick out a movie from that list.
